    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Hello! My name is Yucheng Wang, and I am currently pursuing a master's degree in Business Information Systems. With a passion for both technology and aesthetics, I have recently embarked on a journey into the world of web development.</p>

      <p>My hobbies include swimming and running, which help me maintain a healthy balance between my academic pursuits and personal well-being. I also have a keen interest in antiques, which I find fascinating due to their historical significance and unique charm.</p>

      <p>I am particularly intrigued by web design, especially the areas of UI (User Interface) and UX (User Experience). The visual aspects of web design captivate me, and I am dedicated to mastering these skills to create engaging and user-friendly websites. I understand that the learning curve for UI and UX is steep, requiring extensive research and persistence, but I am committed to achieving proficiency in these areas to meet current market demands and preferences.</p>

      <p>A fun fact about me is that I originally studied Chemistry as an undergraduate. This background has equipped me with a strong analytical mindset and a methodical approach to problem-solving, which I now apply to my studies and projects in web development.</p>

      <p>I am excited about the future and the possibilities that lie ahead as I continue to grow and develop my skills in this dynamic field.</p>
